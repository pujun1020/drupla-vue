        Although it may not seem like the most elegant solution, one of the best ways to control how your skeleton looks
        is to style each element. So that’s what we’re going to do – replace each content block in our ProfileCard with
        a corresponding outline block.
        We will reuse some of the layout styles to ensure that our skeleton has the same outline as our actual
        component. Because we did not limit our styles to scoped in our ProfileCard component, they will automatically
        style our ProfileCardSkeleton component as well.
